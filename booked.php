<h1>Check-In</h1>
<h2>Reservations Information</h2>
Passengers are required to reconfirm their return booking within 72 hours of flight departure. This can be done by contacting the airline. Failure to reconfirm will result in cancellation of your reservation.

Check-in Information
Early check-in is recommended to enable you to complete security checks and allow enough time to get to your boarding gate. The times shown on your ticket are the departure times of the aircraft. Opening and closing times for check-in and boarding vary by airport, therefore it is important to be sure of your local airport times in order to arrive there in plenty of time for your flight. 
 
Domestic Flight: Check in at least 1 and a half hours before departure
International Flight: Check in at least 2 hours before departure
 
When boarding the aircraft, please have your boarding pass along with other travel documentation (passport, visa, etc.) readily available. You will be asked to show your boarding card to the cabin crew on entering the aircraft.

Security Questions:
The following are security questions asked by the check-in agents with respect to hidden dangerous goods and security procedures:
Is this your bag?
Did you pack it yourself?
Has anyone given you anything to carry for him/her?
From the time you packed, have you left your bag unattended?
Do you have any battery-operated items in your bag?

<h2>Prohibited Items:</h2>

Compressed gases – such as butane, oxygen, liquid nitrogen and aqualung cylinders.
Corrosives – such as acids, alkalis, mercury and wet cell batteries.

<h2>Baggage Policy</h2>
Please check the allowances for carry-on and check-in baggage and read the latest information regarding our baggage policies.
Free Baggage Allowances
Your checked baggage allowance may be limited by your class of travel and any combination of dimension and weight, number of pieces, or dimensions. Baggage in excess of the free allowance is subject to extra charge.

Cabin Baggage
The maximum weight of cabin baggage is 8kgs, and each piece must not exceed dimensions of 51cmx20cmx38cm (for flights operated by B767 and B737).
Personal items such as overcoats, walking sticks, small cameras, laptops and ladies' handbags may be carried in the cabin unconditionally.

The following items are not allowed to be carried in hand luggage and should be placed in checked-in baggage:
Catapults; household cutlery; knives; penknives; envelope openers; razor blades; tradesman's tools; darts; scissors; knitting needles; sporting bats and horse whips.
Medicines and toiletries in limited quantities, which are necessary or appropriate for the passenger during the journey, such as hairsprays, perfumes and medicine containing alcohol, may be carried.

Cabin bags MAY contain the following:
Electronic equipment, including laptops, mobile phones, MP3 players, portable music and DVD players, digital and film cameras, and video cameras.
Essential medicines in liquid form; quantities of less than 50ml.
Baby milk and liquid baby food (the contents of each bottle MUST be tasted by the accompanying guardian).
Solid cosmetics.
When a baby carrycot is carried, lightweight articles such as bedding, diapers, feeding bottles and sufficient food for the journey may be carried free, provided the total weight does not exceed 12 kgs.

Sporting Equipment
One is allowed 15kgs of sporting equipment: For example, golf bags over and above the allowed check-in weight.
Other items normally carried in cabin baggage, such as books, medicines in non-liquid form, keys and travel documents, may be carried in the cabin bag, as long as they fit into a bag no larger than 51cmx20cmx38cm.
Push chairs and walking aids, including wheelchairs, are permitted but must be security screened.
To help progress through the airport all customers are asked to adhere to the restrictions. Failure to do so will significantly delay the security screening process and inconvenience other travelers.
Electronic equipment such as laptops will be required to be removed from hand baggage and screened separately. We recommend these items be packed carefully for easy removal at the security search point.

Notice of baggage liability limitations
Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are paid.
Please do not include the following items in your checked in baggage as most carriers do not assume liability for such: Laptop computers, cameras, jewellery, mobile phones, important paper samples, keys, medications and other valuables.
