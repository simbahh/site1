  At GreenCrunch Airways, our vision is to provide ‘Zimbabwean hospitality in the skies’, drawing on our proud legacy of safety, our exceptional pilots and solid customer service. We have a comprehensive technical and engineering base which holds approvals from civil aviation authorities of several countries in the region and beyond. This provides a platform for expansion opportunities in our domestic and external markets, with the option to consider alliances or partnerships with other airlines.
Our engineers have been commended by Boeing, the world's leading aircraft manufacturer, for our sterling work in aircraft modifications and mandatory checks and services. This includes being the first airline to successfully execute a Strut Improvement programme on the B707s.
GreenCrunch Airways also runs Technical and Commercial Training schools at its headquarters, offering courses in ticketing, cargo processes and procedures, aircraft engineering and pilot training. The schools have also trained personnel for domestic and regional operators; and substantial revenue is raised each year through the training of non-Air Zimbabwe staff.
